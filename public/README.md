# Add Your Photo Here

To replace the "AG" initials with your actual photo:

1. **Get your photo ready:**
   - Use a professional headshot
   - Square format works best (e.g., 500x500px or 1000x1000px)
   - JPG or PNG format

2. **Add it to this folder:**
   - Save your photo as `founder.jpg` in this `public` folder
   - Or rename it to `founder.png` and update the code to use `.png`

3. **The photo will automatically appear** on your website where the "AG" initials were!

**Example locations on Windows:**

- Copy from: `C:\Users\YourName\Pictures\your-photo.jpg`
- Paste to: `C:\bga-hub-solutions\public\founder.jpg`

That's it! The website will use your photo automatically.
